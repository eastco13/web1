<h3>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h3>
  <p>
  <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/html"

<p>The web has gone through many changes over the past few decades, but HTML has always been the fundamental language used to develop webpages.</p>
Interestingly, while websites have become more advanced and interactive, HTML has actually gotten simpler. <p style="margin-top:45px;">If you compare the source of an HTML5 page with a similar page written in HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0, the HTML5 page would probably contain less code.</p>
<p>This is because modern HTML relies on cascading style sheets or JavaScript to format nearly all the elements within a page.</p>
